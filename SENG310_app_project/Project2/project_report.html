                    This is a Conceptual Model for Leg Work Application. We develop this conceptual model to better understand all the different moving parts. It is a simple model, but it was enormously useful in clarifying the relationships.

                        When users want an account to do some delivery jobs, he needs to
                        take a photo of his government issued ID. Therefore, on the
                        regisration page, we have a "camera" picture. This picture icon
                        is a metaphor to tell users click here to take the picture.

                        Our designed product provides two services. One is to be a guest,
                        and can order food or shop, and let other users bring the things
                        to him/her. Therefore, we put a “bag” on the button. Because this
                        kind of “bag” picture is a traditional interface metaphor which
                        represents shopping(spending money).

                    <p style="float: left; width: 100%">
                        The other service that our product will provide is help users earn
                        money. Users who owns a car can be the driver, and earn money to
                        delivery things for our “guest users”. This dollar sign will tell
                        users, if they want earn money, just click that button.

                        side. This “cart” is the metaphor to tell users to click this button
                        if they want to pay the money.

                    We will use a series of buttons to jump to different pages. There
					is a camera icon which can upload an ID picture on the register
					page. A pull-down menu shows some options for users. Also, we 
					plan to use a map widget displaying positions and routes, a 
					search bar finding some items demanded, and some on-off checkmarks 
					defaulting options for users.

                    The app’s icon and page’s majority color will be green, and welcome page will be red because red color usually represent quickness and rush. Leg Work provide delivery and hitch service, so speed is very important to the users. All text color needs to be black, and all icon needs to be green. Furthermore, any number related to the money needs to be yellow.

                    This app mainly use Open Sans, try 12-16px for main content and disclaimer,  24-30px for heading and command.   

                    For the screen layout, please refer to our mock up design for the most of parts. And for the Trustee’s task layout part, please refer to the following picture.

            <li style="float: left; width: 100%">How are the requirements from the previous phase realized in our design:</li>
                <p style="float: left; width: 100%">
					We have 4 users requirements identified from the previous phase:<br />1. Users want to save some fuel cost for their cars.<br />2. Users want a more flexible delivery job based on time and places.<br />3. Elder users need big and clear function menus and buttons because of presbyopia.<br />4. Users want a convenient service which can pick them up and send them to certain places with low cost.<br />
<br />1. With the purpose of saving fuel cost, our design gives functions for trustees to go to some places and earn money at the same time. This indirectly saves trustees&acute; fuel cost. When trustees want to go to some places while thinking that the fuel cost is expensive, they can use Legwork to save money. Legwork provides functions to help trustees looking for nearby consignors who wants to go to the same places as what trustees want. When the trustee successfully sends the consignor to the place, the consignor ought to give the trustee a certain amount of money that has been mutually agreed. Trustees can press either &quotPost your job&quot button or &quotFind your job&quot button to look for nearby consignors. After setting the requirements, trustee can select the consignor you want to pick up by pressing their locations under &quotHitch&quot category. At the time you press the location button, Legwork will give you a list of task details, you can see the money you can earn from this task in order to save fuel cost.
<br /><br />2. If users want to find a flexible delivery job, which based on time and places, they can use Legwork to find a flexible delivery job for them. Legwork has an interface for job application. If you want to work for Legwork as a trustee, you have to submit a government issued ID when you are registering for a new account. The job is flexible because Legwork gives trustees&acute; two options to do works. First, trustees can post the jobs that he is able to do. Second, trustees can find all the jobs satisfying his requirements. Also, workers do not have to work 8 hours a day for Legwork. They are able to work at any time, anywhere according to their personal schedule. If they want to work, they can simply open the Legwork in their cell phone to either find jobs or post jobs. 
<br /><br />3. Elders having presbyopia cannot see things clearly. However, Legwork is designed with big and concise buttons and functions for elders to manipulate. The word on the various buttons are mostly very large. For instance, the submit button in the complaint page is written with big capitalized &quotSUBMIT&quot Users can evidently see the clear button. Also, the title of each page is put on the top of the page with much bigger font size than other words. This gives users an immediate impression of the content of the current page. The maps shown in the pages are all larger than 1/3 of that page, which offers users excellent pictorial impression. The overall design of buttons, word texts, and maps aims at providing decent visual experience for each individual. 
<br /><br />4. Legwork provides cheaper prices than other taxi companies. This is because taxi drivers are just sending the customers to where customers want to go. However, our drivers send customers to the same destination to which both drivers and customers want to go. Therefore, the prices set for sending will be cheaper in Legwork than other taxi companies.
